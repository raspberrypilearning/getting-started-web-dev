## What is CSS?

CSS is a language that is used along with HTML to control exactly how the elements on a webpage should look. This includes colours, positioning, and effects (such as rounded corners), as well as transitions that can be used to create animation effects.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**</span> describes exactly how a webpage should look. Without CSS, a webpage would look really boring. 
</p>

This project uses the `style.css` file to control how HTML elements are displayed and the `fiesta.css` file to provide colour and font choices:

### Included style sheets

It's a lot of work to create a complete CSS style sheet with styles that work well together. Many web developers prefer to use an existing style sheet and just adapt it to their needs.

The [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path uses a style sheet that follows best practices and includes styles that are interesting and relevant to young people creating their first web projects.

Creators have the opportunity to adapt and add to the provided styles. This approach helps them to create interesting webpages quickly.

### Included colour and font palettes

Designing colour palettes and fonts that work well together is another time-consuming and skilled task. The three Explore projects include appropriate fonts and colour palettes that creators can customise.

For Design and Invent projects, we have provided a selection of colour palettes and font combinations that creators can choose from.

Creators will also have the option to create their own colour palettes and choose fonts from Google Fonts.

### Use of variables

The style sheets use **CSS variables** to define colours and fonts so that they can easily be changed in one place.

### Responsive design

Responsive webpages and websites adapt to screens of different shapes and sizes including mobile phones. These projects follow modern best practices including the use of the REM unit for sizes (this means that sizes will be based on a user's preferred font size settings) and `flex` content, which wraps when there isn't enough space.

### Accessible design

The included style sheets have all been checked for high colour contrast and creators are encouraged to check colour contrast when they make their own choices.

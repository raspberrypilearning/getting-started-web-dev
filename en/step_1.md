### Introduction to Web Development path

The [Intro to Web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) covers the development of single web pages using HTML and CSS. Future paths will cover more topics including using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages. 

What young people should do before starting Web development:

+ We recommend our [Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch) [paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths) for young creators without previous coding experience. Older beginners (from around age 12) could start with Web Development.  
+ We recommend that creators have basic typing skills before starting web development.

The [Intro to Web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path can be completed before starting Python coding with [Intro to Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro) or [Intro to Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-intro)

### Why learn web development?

Creating webpages and websites is a brilliant way for young people to be creative and share their passions. 

Learning about web technologies is useful for a range of jobs, including web designers and front-end developers. It's also used by entrepreneurs who want to make their own unique website to communicate their business or brand.

### Introduction to web development path

The [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path covers the development of single webpages using HTML and CSS. Future paths will cover more topics, including using JavaScript to create dynamic webpages. 

What young people should do before starting the 'Intro to web' path:

+ We recommend our [Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch) [paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths) for young creators without previous coding experience. Older beginners (from around age 12) could start with the web development path.  
+ We recommend that creators have basic typing skills before starting the web development path.

The [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path can be completed before starting Python coding with [Intro to Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro) or [Intro to Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-intro) path.

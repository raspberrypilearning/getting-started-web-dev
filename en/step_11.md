## Useful tips

### Collapse the code

Your HTML file can get quite long which makes it hard to find the parts you need to work on. To make your code easier to read you can collapse parts of it that you donâ€™t need to focus on right now then expand them later.

Click on the small triangle next to any section of code you want to collapse. 

### Use placeholder text

Add placeholder text to your webpage to see what your layout looks like:

[[[add-placeholder-text]]]

### Comment your code

You can add helpful comments to both your HTML and CSS files:

[[[web-comment-code]]]

### Think about your audience

Where possible view your published web page on a number of different devices such as a laptop, phone or tablet to view your web page from the lens of many different visitors. 

**Tip:** If you do not have access to other devices, you can drag the bar between the text editor and your web page output to make the web page wider or narrower.

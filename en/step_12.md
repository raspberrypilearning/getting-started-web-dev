## Our web projects

Our 'Intro to web' path has six projects to help you learn different web skills to create your own projects independently.

You can return to this reference guide, 'Getting started with web development', whenever you need to remind yourself of the skills you have learnt.

### Beginner web projects

The [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path covers the development of single webpages using HTML and CSS. Future paths will cover more topics including using JavaScript to create dynamic webpages.

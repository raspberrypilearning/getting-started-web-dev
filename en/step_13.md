## Our web projects

Our web paths have six projects each, to help you learn different web skills, in order to create your own projects independently.

You can return to this reference guide, Getting started with web development, whenever you need to remind yourself of the skills you have learnt.

### Beginner web projects

The [Intro to Web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) covers the development of single web pages using HTML and CSS. Future paths will cover more topics including using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages.

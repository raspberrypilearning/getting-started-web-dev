## Vocabulary for web development

## Web development

+ The **World Wide Web** or **web** is a vast collection of connected webpages. 

+ A **webpage** is a single page of content with a web address or Universal Resource Locator (URL). 

+ A **website** is a group of webpages with the same domain name.

+ A **domain name** is the part of a web address after `http://` or `https://`, for example `projects.raspberrypi.org`.

+ A **web developer** or **front-end developer** is someone who creates websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### HTML

+ The **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** language is used to structure a webpage so that a web browser (or screen reader) knows what to do with the content.

+ HTML uses **tags** to 'mark up' content so that a web browser or screen reader knows how to present it. Tags start and end with angle brackets and most have a matching end tag. For example, `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags are used to start and end a level one heading. 

+ The different parts of an HTML page are called **elements** and include tags. `<h1>The Heading</h1>` is a level one heading element.

+ HTML elements can have **attributes** which provide additional information. This example, `<img src="happy.png" alt="A happy face">` has a `src` attribute with a value for the image name and a `alt` attribute with a value for the alternative text to be used if an image cannot be viewed. 

+ Elements can be **inline** or **block** level elements. An **inline** element is an element that is within a phrase. For example `<strong>` creates a bold piece of text. A **block** element is a whole block of HTML, like a `<section>` or a `<blockquote>`.


### CSS

+ The **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** language  describes exactly how a webpage should look.

+ A CSS file contains a list of **rules**. 

+ Each rule has a list of **properties** with values. For example `color: teal` sets the colour property to the teal colour. 

+ Each rule has a **selector** which says which HTML elements to apply the rule to. This could be the name of an HTML element or `.classname` where 'classname' is the name of a class that can be applied to HTML elements to use the style. 

+ A CSS **class** is used to apply rules to HTML elements that have that class applied. For example `<section class="primary">` applies the primary class to a section element which means that the properties defined in rules with the `.primary` selector will be used. 

+ A CSS file is often called a **style sheet**. 

+ CSS can use **variables** to hold data about things that can change, like the font and font colours. Using variables makes it much quicker to change the styling of a whole page because you just change what is being held by the variable. 

+ CSS allows you to create **animations**. This is where the style of an element changes from one style to another over a time period. Cool effects, like pulsing, can be made using CSS animations.

## What is HTML?

HTML is the language that is used to write webpages. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)**</span> is used to structure a webpage so that a web browser (or screen reader) knows what to do with the content. 
</p>

HTML defines a set of **tags** that start and end with angle brackets and are used to 'mark up' webpage content. 

This is a small example of a webpage: 

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/html/0ed1fa32e8" width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Try to change the text between the `<h1>` and `</h1>` start and end tags. 'h1' is a level one heading. 

### Use of semantic HTML tags
The [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path uses modern best practices for HTML including the use of the 'semantic' tags `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` which provide more information to web browsers and screen readers about the purpose of the content.

## Starter projects
Each project includes a starter template so that webpages will follow best practices and young people can focus on the more creative parts of web development.

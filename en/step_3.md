## What is CSS?

CSS is a language that is used along with HTML to control exactly how the elements on a web page should look. This includes colours, positioning and effects such as rounded corners as well as transitions that can be used to create animation effects. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**</span> describes exactly how a web page should look. Without CSS a web page would look really boring.</span> 
</p>

This project uses the `style.css` file to control how HTML elements are displayed and the `fiesta.css` file to provide colour and font choices:

### Included style sheets
It's a lot of work to create a complete CSS style sheet with styles that work well together. Many web developers prefer to use an existing style sheet and just adapt it to their needs. 

The [Intro to Web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path uses a style sheet that we have developed to follow best practices and include styles that are interesting and relevant to young people creating their first web projects. 

Creators have the opportunity to adapt and add to the provided styles. This approach gets them creating interesting web pages quickly.

### Included colour and font palettes
Designing colour palettes and fonts that work well together is another time-consuming and skilled task. The three Explore projects include appropriate fonts and colour palettes which creators can customize.

For Design and Invent projects we have provided a selection of colour palettes and font combinations that creators can choose from. 

Creators will also have the option to create their own colour palettes and choose fonts from Google fonts. 

### Use of variables
The style sheets use **CSS variables** to define colours and fonts so that they can easily be changed in one place. 

### Responsive design
Responsive web page and web sites adapt to screens of different shapes and sizes including mobile phones. Our projects follow modern best practices including the use of the REM unit for sizes (this means that sizes will be based on a user's preferred font size settings) and `flex` content which wraps when their isn't enough space.

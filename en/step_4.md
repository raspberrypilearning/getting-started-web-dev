## Create your first webpage

To prepare for facilitating this path, you can try to create your own webpage. The [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path uses the Code Editor, so there is no software to install. 

In this step, you will add HTML and CSS using the same approach as in our web projects. 

--- task ---

Open this [starter project](https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/gswd-starter){:target="_blank"}. It will open in a separate browser tab.

You need to switch between these instructions and the editor. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

The Code Editor will open the `index.html` page. 

Add the highlighted code:

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 15
line_highlights: 16
---
<body>
    <h1>The heading</h1>
</body>

--- /code ---

**Notice:** The name of the file you need to edit is displayed and the line numbers and highlighted code show the changes you need to make. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Click **Run** and check that your title appears in the result area of Trinket. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now click on the `style.css` file tab in the Trinket editor. The file is empty. 

Add the following CSS **rule**:

--- code ---
---
language: css
filename: style.css
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 15
line_highlights: 16
---
h1 {
    color: teal;
    text-align: center;
}
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Check that your heading has changed colour and is centred.

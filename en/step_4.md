## Create your first webpage

To prepare for facilitating this path, you can try to create your own webpage. The [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro) path uses the Trinket online editor, so there is no software to install. 

**Tip:** If you use Trinket in a school, a library, or another place that has internet filtering, then check you are able to access Trinket. See the [Trinket FAQs](https://trinket.io/faq){:target="_blank"} for more information. 

In this step, you will add HTML and CSS using the same approach as in our web projects. 

--- task ---

Open this [starter project](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/d048a9e878){:target="_blank"}. It will open in a separate browser tab.

You need to switch between these instructions and the editor.

Trinket opens the `index.html` page. 

Add the highlighted code:

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 15
line_highlights: 16
---
<body>
    <h1>The heading</h1>
</body>

--- /code ---

**Notice:** The name of the file you need to edit is displayed and the line numbers and highlighted code show the changes you need to make.

Trinket automatically updates the webpage output.

**Test:** Check that your title appears in the result area of Trinket.

Now click on the `style.css` file tab in the Trinket editor. The file is empty. 

Add the following CSS **rule**:

--- code ---
---
language: css
filename: style.css
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 15
line_highlights: 16
---
h1 {
    color: teal;
    text-align: center;
}
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

**Test:** Check that your heading has changed colour and is centred.

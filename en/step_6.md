<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Webpages can be viewed on many different devices and should be <span style="color: #0faeb0">**responsive**</span> to each device. This means that if a user views your site on a mobile phone, it should respond to a smaller screen and if they view it on a desktop PC it should respond to a larger screen.

CSS can also be used to responsively change the layout of the page.

## Debug your webpage

Debugging is a process to find and fix mistakes in the code that are called bugs.

It’s easier to identify issues if you make one change at a time. It might take a few experiments for your project to look the way that you planned.

**Tip:** Add comments to your code. Use everyday language to explain what the code does. Sometimes, this will make you realise that your code does not actually do what you want it to do! Comments are useful for when you want to understand your code later, and they help other people to understand your projects.

### Common bugs

You might find some common bugs in your HTML or CSS that you need to fix. Here are some examples:

**Ma page web ne s'affiche pas correctement**

[[[incorrect-tags]]]

[[[mismatched-tags]]]

**Autres questions de débogage**

[[[image-not-displayed]]]

[[[font-not-displayed]]]

[[[web-debug-link]]]

Tu pourrais trouver un bogue qui n'est pas répertorié ici. Can you figure out how to fix it?

**Tip:** If you cannot find the problem after you have tried these techniques, then take a break or work on a different part of your project. When you come back, you might find the bug straight away!

Nous aimerions connaître tes bogues et la façon dont tu les as résolus. Use the feedback button at the bottom of this page to tell us about your project and let us know if you found a different bug.
